				DeVille's is a restaurant in the affluent village of Dalkey, Co. Dublin, home to many of Ireland's multi-millionaires. the client company is looking for a website re-design that will properly reflect their passion
				<br><br>
				the origional website got negative reviews because users weren't able to navigate the site properly in order to make reservations and purchase vouchers. based on the content of the reviews, we hypothesised what we could do to make the user's experience better.

				<br>the empathy-mapping process helps distil and categorise your knowledge of the user into one place. It can be used to capture who a user is. it makes sense of qualitative research (research notes, user-interviews).
